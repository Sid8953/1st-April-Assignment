    "\n",

    "The output of logistic regression is the probability of the occurrence of a particular event or class. It uses the logistic function (sigmoid function) to constrain the output between 0 and 1.\n",

    "In logistic regression, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. The regularization term introduces a bias into the model by penalizing large coefficients, thereby discouraging the model from fitting the training data too closely. Regularization helps to generalize the model by controlling its complexity and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "\n",

    "Evaluation of Logistic Regression Model:\n",
    "The ROC curve and AUC provide valuable insights into the discriminatory power and performance of a logistic regression model across different threshold settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with an ROC curve closer to the upper-left corner (towards [0, 1]) and a higher AUC indicates better performance, as it achieves higher TPR (sensitivity) while keeping FPR (1 - specificity) lower across various thresholds."
