    "A decision tree classifier partitions data into subsets based on features, creating a tree-like structure where nodes represent feature splits. It recursively selects the best feature to split data, optimizing criteria like Gini impurity or information gain. This process continues until leaf nodes predict class labels. During prediction, data traverse the tree, following the path to determine the final class label."

    "A decision tree for binary classification predicts outcomes by splitting data into two branches at each node, categorizing instances into one of two classes. It recursively selects features that best separate the data based on criteria like Gini impurity or information gain. The tree continues this process until reaching leaf nodes, which represent the final predicted classes (e.g., Yes/No, True/False, 0/1) for the binary problem."

These boundaries are orthogonal, forming axis-aligned splits. During prediction, data points traverse the tree, following splits until reaching a leaf node that assigns a class label based on majority voting or probability estimation within that region, enabling accurate classification."

    "A confusion matrix is a tabular representation showing a classification model's predictions compared to actual labels. It presents counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). It helps assess model performance by calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, aiding in understanding the model's ability to correctly classify instances and identify types of prediction errors."
